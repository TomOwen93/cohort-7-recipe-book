* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 4tbsp olive oil
* 1 lime, juiced
* Tabasco  
**To serve:**
* 8 tortillas

* 230g fresh salsa

## **Method:**  
**STEP 1**  
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and wrap 8 medium tortillas in foil.

**STEP 2**  
Mix 1 heaped tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp ground coriander, a pinch of ground cumin, 2 crushed garlic cloves, 4 tbsp olive oil, the juice of 1 lime and 4-5 drops Tabasco together in a bowl with a big pinch each of salt and pepper.

**STEP 3**  
Stir 2 finely sliced chicken breasts, 1 finely sliced red onion, 1 sliced red pepper and 1 finely sliced red chilli, if using, into the marinade.

**STEP 4**  
Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and add the chicken and marinade to the pan.

**STEP 5**  
Keep everything moving over a high heat for about 5 mins using tongs until you get a nice charred effect. If your griddle pan is small you may need to do this in two batches.

**STEP 6**  
To check the chicken is cooked, find the thickest part and tear in half â€“ if any part is still raw cook until done.

**STEP 7**  
Put the tortillas in the oven to heat up and serve with the cooked chicken, a bag of mixed salad and one 230g tub of fresh salsa.
