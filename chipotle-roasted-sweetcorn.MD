# Chipotle Roasted Sweetcorn with Squash, Black Beans, Feta & Lime

## By Rukmini Iyer

Here's what she had to say about this dish:

> This dish feels like a festival to me, with its bright colours and textures – crispy black beans, soft feta, spiced squash and toasted corn on the cob. Serve as part of a Mexican style sharing feast, or on its own with coriander rice.
